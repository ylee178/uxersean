      <p class="desc-text">Metigy is an AI marketing platform and their plan was to consolidate multiple marketing channels such as Google, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, etc so their users can manage multi-channel ads in one place. 
      Metigy UX team ran quantitative survey with 75 potential users. 32 out of the 75 respondents were "advanced users" who were the main target as they are likely to use more than one advertising channel. From the survey, "Checking analytics" turned out to be one of the least enjoyed part of the paid media marketing process.
      <img style="margin-bottom: 30px;" class="full-screen" src="./images/mywork/least-enjoy.jpg" alt="quantitative survey result 1">
    Also, reporting functionality was voted as the most important feature for all-in-one ads platform. Based on these insights, the team has decided to build multi-channel ads reporting as a first phase of the project.

          <p class="desc-text">From the quantitative survey, I could figure out what needs to be on the dashboard for users to analyse their ads from multi-channels. We have left out customisability in this phase and focus on getting static metrics right.</p>

          <p class="desc-text">I have gathered all relevant user insights and reporting parts from native platforms and competitors. This enabled me to understand how other platforms display insights and handle importing ads. Design ideas started flowing into me so I visualised them in lo-fi prototypes first.</p>
          <img style="margin-bottom: 30px;" class="full-screen" src="./images/mywork/mca-brainstorm.jpg" alt="triage user needs">

          <p class="desc-text">I have shared lo-fi designs early with the Ad squad as well as data team. This has speeded up the process of developing the ideas and checking feasibility on the go. At the end of the 8th iteration, we came to consensus on the structure that we want to test with our users.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 18px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>Agreed Structure:</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Multi-channel filter, accounts filter & date picker without comparison</li>
              <li>Sync Ads for bringing ads from native platforms</li>
              <li>Export functionality (pdf, csv, png)</li>
              <li>Ad Creation functionality (limited to Google as it is the only available creation option in Metigy</li>
              <li>Group metrics by ad goal for users to find desired metrics quickly</li>
              <li>Line charts to show ad performances of multi-channel</li>
              <li>All Ads synced to Metigy to be shown in a table in Ad List</li>

      <p class="desc-text">I have decided to use a hi-fi prototype for testing. Because "Ease of Use" was the most important factor for all-in-one platform, validating usability and discoverability of components is crucial for the feature to be successful.</p>
      <img style="margin-bottom: 30px;" class="full-screen" src="./images/mywork/mca-hifi.jpg" alt="hifi prototype">
      <p>I have collaborated with PM and Researcher to decide research questions and how we should ask them without leading users. We have recruited 6 users who are using more than one social medial channel for paid-ads (4 advanced / 2 novice users). For the first half of the interview, we have asked them how they are currently running their ads and their reporting process. For the rest half, we tested the prototype.</p>

    <p>The results were very insightful and clearly gave us the direction to make the feature more attractive for our users.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 18px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>Positive Feedback:</b></p>
      <ul class="desc-text">
        <li>Testers loved the consolidated reporting feature so that they don't need to jump between native platforms.</li>
        <li>Metrics comparison cards were very appealing to them as they can figure out which channel is best performing.</li>
      </ul>

    <p style="font-size: 18px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>To Be Improved:</b></p>
      <ul class="desc-text">
        <li>Testers have different goals depending on their business stages. Showing every metrics will not be preferable for them and even some metrics like ROI, Conversions may not be available as not every business has online sales.</li>
        <li><i>Saving time</i> is what makes them to use this so provide commentaries about how they are doing rather than just showing the metrics/graphs.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In the new design, the main line graph was validated that it is more used for reading trends and users prefer metric cards as it is quicker. So I have added the line graphs in each card for users to view trend for each metric without clicking cards to switch the graph.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 18px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>AI Engineered Features</b></p>
      <ul class="desc-text">
        <li>AI will analyse what is shown on the dashboard and suggest insights with recommended actions in the right panel to help users understand the dashboard. This way, they can save time on analysing the insights by themseleves and quickly use the AI insights for reporting straight away. Also, they can export the insights to include them in their existing reporting templates.</li>
        <li>At the bottom of the dashboard, I have introduced Keywords & Topics card where users can see what are popular keywords and topics for their audience. The AI analyse the search keywords, comments and reactions from users' ads and help users adjust their content strategies.</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="font-size: 18px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>Dashboard For Users With No Trackers</b></p>
      <ul class="desc-text">
        <li>For the users without trackers, basic ad performance metrics provided from native platforms will be only available.</li>
        <li>These users are likely to be novice at early business stages so metrics to assess their business awareness will be most important. This is also backed by the quant survey results (Awareness and Engagement are top ad goals).</li>
        <li>In the new design, I have added Audience Growth Rate and Engagement Rate as that turned out to be what was missing from the test prototype in terms of understanding users' target audience and getting insights to retarget the audience.</li>
      </ul>

      <p style="font-size: 18px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>Dashboard For Users With Trackers</b></p>
      <ul class="desc-text">
        <li>When users have the trackers, the metrics will be more rich. We can provide more metrics related to their return on investment.</li>
        <li>I have added a filter for sorting the metrics by goals so users can quickly view what they care the most.</li>

      <p style="font-size: 18px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>Comparison Mode</b></p>
      <ul class="desc-text">
        <li>Comparing metrics was HOT when we tested with users, so I have decided to make it more flexible. Users now can select different metrics to compare and easily see which channel is best performing for the selected metrics. They can also compare metrics in different timeframes.</li>

      <p>I think the AI-ness of the product can be vastly enhanced by introducing voice command. Users can quickly speak keywords to get AI engineered insights. It could be very appealing to the users as to time saving.<br/>
      Metigy went into administration without any notice, and the project had to end at this stage. Even the moment I am writing this now, I feel very passionate about the product and the project. This could grow so much bigger and impact our users enormously. It's a shame to see it has to ends this way. The last image is a userflow diagram I created for multi-channel ads, and it was what the wonderful team was going to achieve ultimately. RIP Metigy...</p>
